## Things to Try

1. Use unsigned integers of various sizes (`uint8`, `uint16`, etc...). See how the storage size affects the number of participants we can hold.
2. Use signed integers of various sizes instead of unsigned and see how that affects our storage size.
3. Create a setter function called `setParticipants` that will allow us to change the number of participants
4. Create a getter function called `getParticipants` and see how this is different from having a public `participants`
