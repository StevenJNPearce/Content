## Who has my Ether?

Let's create a function `findAddresses` that will take in an `address` string and find all the addresses it has sent ether to. 

This function should resolve [asynchronously](?tab=details&scroll=Asynchronous%20Function) and use [Web3 1.0](?tab=details&scroll=Web3). 

> This challenge will test your Web3 and JS Promise skills. Expect to dig deep into the documentation in each area if you feel stuck.
