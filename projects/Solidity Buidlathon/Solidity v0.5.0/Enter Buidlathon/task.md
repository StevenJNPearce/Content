## Enter Buidlathon

It's time to allow participants to join our Buidlathon! 

### Enter Functon 

Let's create a `public` `enter` function that will allow an ethereum address to join our Buidlathon! 

For this Tutorial you can choose to store the addresses in an array or a mapping, your choice! You can find more about both in the Details section.

### Number of Participants

To pass the test cases for this stage, you'll need to create a `public` getter called `numberOfParticipants` which will return the number of participants we have allowed into the hackathon thus far.
