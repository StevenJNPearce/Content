## Structs and Loops

Now we're going to work on creating teams with members in each team.

1. Create a `Team` struct for storing team `members` and `name`
2. Create a `teams` array for storing each registered team
3. Create a `register` function which allows us to register a new team
4. Create a `join` function which allows members to join a particular team by it's index. 
5. Create a `getMyTeamName` function, which will find the team `name` for a particular user.
