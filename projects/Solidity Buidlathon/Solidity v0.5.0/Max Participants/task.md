## Storing Max Participants

### Public Integer

For our Buidlathon we want to determine the maximum number of participants we can admit. 

Let's set a `public` `uint` called `maxParticipants` within our contract. 

### Constructor

Next we'll want to create a constructor which will take in a `uint` of its own and store it within the public `maxParticipants` integer we just created.
