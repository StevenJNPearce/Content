## Integers

In Solidity, signed integers can be defined with `int` and unsigned with `uint`. Being "signed" simply means that it can indicate positive or negative values. Unsigned values do not need to dedicate a bit to the sign so they can store just about double the values! 

A `public` integer can be defined as follows:

```
uint public myNumberVariable;
```

See more about Integers [in the Solidity Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#integers).
