## Projects

Let's create some projects for teams as well.

1. Create a `Project` struct for stores the project `title` and a boolean of  whether it was `submitted`.
2. Add a `Project` to the  `Team` struct.
3. Create a `submitProject` function which will allows a particular team to add a project `title` and `submit` their project.
4. Create a `getMyProject` function which will return a project `title` for the account.
