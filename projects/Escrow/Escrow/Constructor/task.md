## Contract Constructor

1. Write a [Contract Constructor](?tab=details&scroll=Contract%20Constructor) that will store the addresses at each of the member variables you declared in the previous stage.
> The `arbiter` and `beneficiary` will be arguments to the constructor (in that order respectfully) and the `depositor` will be the address calling the function!!!
