## Getting Setup
Hey there, welcome to the Escrow Contract module!

In this **Task** section you'll find what you need to pass this step. For a more in-depth view switch to the **Details** pane.

You can also look at your `testContract.js` to see the exact tests you need to pass. Once you feel confident in your code, click "Run Tests" to try and pass this stage!

1. Declare a [Solidity Pragma 0.4.19](?tab=details&scroll=Solidity%20Pragma)
2. Create [three public addresses](?tab=details&scroll=Address%20Member%20Variables) for the `arbiter`, `beneficiary`, and `depositor`

> These addresses will need to be public and use these exact variable names in order for your tests to pass.
