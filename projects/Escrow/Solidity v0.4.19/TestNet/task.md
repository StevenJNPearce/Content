## Deploy to the TestNet

Before deploying to the mainnet, we will deploy to the testnet. We will need to acquire some testnet ether in order to deploy and interact with our smart contract.

1. Download or Login to the [Metamask](?tab=details&scroll=Metamask) extension
2. Request test-ether from a [faucet](?tab=details&scroll=Faucets)
3. Deploy your contract to the TestNet
