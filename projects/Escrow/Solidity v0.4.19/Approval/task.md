## Arbiter Approval

Now we're going to need to make something so a third party (the `arbiter`) can approve the transfer of funds. 

The `arbiter` will be responsible to validate the transaction and move the funds from the `depositor` to the `beneficiary`.

1. Create the [`approve`](?tab=details) function
2. Transfer the contract balance to the beneficiary
