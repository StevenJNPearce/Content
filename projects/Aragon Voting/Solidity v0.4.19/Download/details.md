## Congratulations!!

You did it! But your journey does not end here. 

Download all the code you've written in the Aragon React framework and you'll be able to continue to build on what you've created. 

This framework is based off of the Aragon React boilerplate, if you're looking to build on another kit let us know! 

Be sure to check out the `README.md` for more instructions on how to get started and for all the pre-requisite information.

And jump in our [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/chainshotnodes/shared_invite/enQtMzU3ODc5NTM3MTI3LTFlZTY1YzcwM2QzYWI0ODY2ZDczMmYzOTVlYWQwZjkyZDFlYzUxZWM4NDNlNjk3N2EyNGMwOGQ0ZTVkZjQyNjE) to ask any questions or discuss where to go from here!
