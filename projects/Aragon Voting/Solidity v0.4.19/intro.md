## Aragon Voting Dapp

### What we'll build

This Building Block will walk you through creating your own Aragon Voting Decentralized Application! It will be a simplified version of Aragon's own [Voting application](https://wiki.aragon.org/dev/apps/voting/).  

This application will allow a user to create a vote, and allow voters to pick yes or no on the particular question. The voters will be able to change their vote and the counts will change accordingly.

At the end of the Building Block you'll have an application that looks something like this:

### What we'll use

We'll start by creating a basic voting application in Solidity. Once we have achieved this we'll integrate the smart contracts from the [Aragon OS](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-ref.html) to empower our voting app with built-in authentication and governance! 

Once we have our voting smart contracts complete we'll focus on building out the front-end with the help of the [Aragon JS](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonjs-ref.html) library which will allow us to communicate with our smart contracts from within the Aragon Client. 

### Pre-requisite knowledge

Building this application will require some pre-requisite knowledge. 

You should be fairly comfortable with the basics of Solidity. If you're new to solidity we recommend you check out our [Escrow Building Block](https://www.chainshot.com/blocks/5adab204929d249e5faefb4c/) first!

On the front-end you'll need to have some JavaScript proficiency as well. We'll touch on both [Observables](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable) and [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). We'll provide some contextual information for both, but it would be best to get a solid understanding of these concepts beforehand!
