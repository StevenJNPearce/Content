## Genesis Blockchain

The genesis block is the first block in the chain, where it all kicks off. Every block after the genesis block links back to the first one, but the genesis block has no previous block! This is important to keep in mind for the next few stages.

Here are some examples of genesis blocks on live blockchains displayed in their respective block explorers:
