## UTXO Token

Hey there! The goal of this code challenge is to create a Token contract which will use a UTXO model to track its balances.

### Challenge Skills

By completing this challenge you demonstrate your knowledge of the UTXO model as well as emitting events, reverting transactions for security, working with mappings and the `bytes32` data type.

The UTXO model is used in Bitcoin and Plasma Implementations, so it's quite a useful thing to learn!
