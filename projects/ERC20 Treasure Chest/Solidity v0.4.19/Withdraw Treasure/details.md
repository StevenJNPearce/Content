## ERC20 Standard

ERC20 is a standard contract that is used by most tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem. It has six functions that are used to handle the supply and transfers of the tokens. 

The original proposal for ERC20 can be [found here](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/20). 

As far as implementation, the [Consensys EIP20 Token](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens/blob/master/contracts/eip20/EIP20.sol) is used for this challenge.
