## Root Hash

Hi there! The goal of this code challenge is to find a root hash from a series of hashes derived by splitting a potentially large bytes array into 32 byte chunks. 

### Challenge Skills

By completing this challenge you demonstrate knowledge of manipulating byte arrays including splitting, hashing and concatenation. 

This can be used for things like validating Merkle Proofs, so it's a useful thing to learn!
