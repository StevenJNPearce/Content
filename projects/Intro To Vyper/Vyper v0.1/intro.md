## Intro to Vyper

Hey there! Welcome to this Vyper programming introduction. 

### What is Vyper? 

Vyper is a programming language with python syntax that can be compiled and executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 

In this regard, it is similar to [Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io) which has had the most adoption for Ethereum Smart Contract development to this point. 

Vyper, however, seeks to distinguish itself by focusing on three particular goals **Security**, **Language Simplicity** and **Auditability**. 

As we move along this coding tutorial we'll seek to illustrate these principles in action. In the meantime, you can read more about Vyper's goals and features in its [documentation](https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### What does this Intro teach?

This intro will dive into some of the fundamentals of Vyper by helping you create your own simple token implementation. Among these fundamentals are:

1. **Value Types** - Specifically `uint256`, `bytes` and `address`
2. **Mappings** - Key-value stores that can associate values for later lookup/modification
3. **Contract State** - State variables: how to create getters as well as how to update
4. **Functions** - Including constructors and state changing functions
