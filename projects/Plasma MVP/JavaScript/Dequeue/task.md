## Peeking & Dequeuing

We're going to create two functions that will allow us to see the front item on the queue and another one that will allow us to remove that item from the queue.

Create two public functions: 

1. a `dequeue` function which removes one item from the queue.
2. a `peek` function which shows the item that will be removed from the queue on the next `dequeue`. Throw if there is no such item.

> Remember that a Queue is a [FIFO Stucture](?tab=details).
