## Exit Architecture

We're going to be building two methods for handling exits: 

1. **Start Exit** - This will allow users to exit their funds from the Plasma Chain if they have ownership of an unspent transaction output.

2. **Challenge Exit** - This will allow users to challenge other exits if they have proof that the funds have been spent elsewhere.
