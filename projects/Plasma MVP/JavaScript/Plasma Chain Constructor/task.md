We are now going to begin building the `PlasmaChain` in JavaScript. The `PlasmaChain` relies upon the `utils.js` and `plasmaObjects.js` files to work properly. Please see the details tab for an overview of each file.

## Constructor

1. Assign the operator address to a class variable `operator` 
2. Initialize a new Plasma contract instance using `web3` and assign the contract to a class the variable `plasmaContract`
