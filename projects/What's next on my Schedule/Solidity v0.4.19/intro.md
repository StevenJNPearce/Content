## What's next on my Schedule?

This is a Solidity Smart Contract challenge where you will be given a smart contract with a list of meetings and you'll need to find the nearest one that hasn't already passed. 

### Challenge Skills

By completing this challenge you show that you can iterate through a Solidity array of structs and sort uint timestamps in Solidity based on its proximity to the current time, which is an available global to your smart contract.
