## ERC-721

ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible, ERC-721 tokens are all unique.

A good article explaining the standard can be found [here](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/the-anatomy-of-erc721-e9db77abfc24).

## Non-Fungible Token

An asset that is non-fungible simply means that asset A does not necessarily have the same value as asset B. These assets have unique properties which allow their value to be determined by the market. Do you remember Pokemon cards? A Charizard had a much higher value than a Pidgey and was quite difficult to get your hands on. 

On the other hand, the US dollar is a fungible asset. Trading $20 with your friend for $20 leaves neither party in a more advantageous situation since the values are intrinsic to the asset itself and each $20 bill's value is determined at the time it is minted.
