## Decentralized Stash  

Our squirrel friend is excited because today we unveil our brand new decentralized Stash smart contract! Squirrels can finally forget about all those harsh crypto winters! 

Unfortunately word amongst the forest critters is that the `Stash.sol` has a security vulnerability! Can you find the vulnerability and fix it before some chipmunk comes along and takes the squirrels hard-earned Wei?

**Fix the vulnerable `Stash.sol` Smart Contract before the chipmunk comes along and steals the squirrel's balance.** 

*Once you believe you have fixed the code, use "Run Tests" to test and make sure it functions properly and passes all test cases.*
